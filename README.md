# WarpPlugin
Imitation of the warp plugin with some additions.
Commands:
- /setwarp warp_name : Sets warp where the player stands.
- /warp warp_name : Teleports player to a pre-set location.
- /warplist : Prints the list of warps.
- /warp del warp_name : Deletes a warp if exists.

The plugin uses a file named "warps.txt" to save a data created in game.
